                <b>Goal Based Advancement is a system agnostic leveling system. </b> Goal Based Advancement was created from a desire of giving players in my 
                tabletop roleplaying game campaigns more agency and control of how quickly their character progresses.
                </p>
                <p>Traditional leveling systems tie progression to an abstract resource called experience. Players gain experience when they resolve conflict. Conflicts can come in any form but ussually
                    are a combot encounter or a set of objectives concluding in a short storyline (quest). In video games, the player has little to no control over the circumstances they gain experience. In linear games, 
                    the player progresses while following the storyline they have been forced into, invalidating any choice in the system. Open world games try to allievate the problem by offering choice in story line and objectives
                    resulting in the player's experience indirectly correlating to their own choices. The choices players make and how they approach gameplay segments is ussually arbirtrary because gains are often balanced 
                    to provide similar amounts of experience regardless of the direction players choose. 
                </p>
                <p>Certain games have taken steps to provide an alternative progression experience. Behesda's the Elder Scrolls franchise popularized tieing progression primarily to individual skills. Undertale under scores experience in the context of morality,
                    forcing the player to choose between growing stronger or killing innocents. Tabletop roleplaying games have traditionally used leveling systems similar to video games, assigning an experience value to different enemies and conflicts 
                however, a new push for fiction-first gameplay has led to tabletop roleplaying games to adapting more abstract experience systems. 
                </p>
                <p>Dungeons and Dragons has seen a divergence from it's tradtional experience system toward an alternative "milestone" system. In the milestone system, players gain experience when they complete storylines within the game. Players may gain more experience depending
                    on the size of the objective or whether it relates to their character. Milestone experience ultimatly functions identically to tradtional experience because players are only rewarded for completing pre-defined objectives. In all previous mentioned, the responsiblity of progression is controlled by system's arbitor whether
                that be a digital system or a game master instead of the individuals completing the objectives.
                </p>
                <p>I was inspired by the tabeltop roleplaying games Burning Wheel and Blades in the Dark to create a experience system controlled by the players. In both Burning Wheel and Blades in the Dark, experience is tied to 
                    the player's individual actions. Tabletop roleplaying games are played momment to momment allowing the players and game master to evaluate the value of actions as they manifest. Blades in the Dark uses a series of broad questions
                    to determine whether players have advanced depending on their character's personality. The Blades in the Dark character "the Hound", a percise and persistant hunter, would be asked if "they addressed a situation with tracking or violence" granting them
                    experience based off their intention rather then the specifics of the situation. Burning Wheel takes individual experience a step forward asking players to outline their own objectives to complete within play.</p> <p>A player objective in Burning Wheel can be anything the player decides
                    but the responsiblity rests completely on the player on accomplishing their task. After a session of play, the player evalutes whether they have completed their objective and awards themselves experience if they have succeeded. Players are asked to journal about in character conclusion based off the situation.
                    The journaling is meant to prompt character development narrativly a long with mechanically. 
                </p>
                <p>Goal Based Advancement emulates Burning Wheel by allowing players to set their own objectives. Players define their own objectives at the start of a session and adventure and are tasked with evaluating those goals when play concludes. Players only gain experience for the goal when they complete it. Players may recieve experience at different rates using this system but it 
                    puts control of the player's progession in their hands. Players are incentived to choose goals they can complete with out reliance on the world around them leading to increased player agency. Players additionally define a long term goal which provides a large amount of experience when completed. Players will gain 
                    incremental experience while they work towards their long term task. Tieing experience to long and short term goals and giving the control to player rewards them for following compeleing their own interests instead of depending on arbitrary reward systems. Players
                    understand when and how they can grow their character because they control the system. 
                </p>
                <p>I ran a game of Dungeons and Dragons usign Goal Based Experience for a year. Players consitantly moved toward advancing thier own goals in the narrative. Goal Based Advancement is best used for long term campaigns featuring a consistant cast of characters. Short term campaigns or games where the cast of characters frequently changes do not
                    work well with Goal Based Advancement because players do not have the sufficent time to invest and complete thier own goals. After resolving a goal, players are asked to journal in character about their thoughts concerning the goal's resolution. Goal Based Advancement is fully released with supplemental sheets for recording and resolving goals. </p>
