                <p><b>Project Barony is a tabletop roleplaying for campaigns focused around large scale political and faction-based story telling</b> Project Barony is a
                    a alpha system I am developing based from the Worlds of Legacy system reference document. Development was initally started as an experiement of bringing friends into a tabletop roleplaying campaign to play as
                    feudals territories in a medieval european setting.
                </p>
                <p> I am interested in how games can simulate vibrant, living worlds. Open world video games such as Skyrim and Red Dead Redepemption take care in crafting artifical social 
                behaviors and systems to increase the plausability of the player experience. Grand strategy games such as Sid Meier's Civization franchise or Crusader Kings attempt to abstract 
            more complex systems such as politics and nation building by assigning artifical intentions and goals to non player caharacters. However simulations will always be bound by the systems they are built upon.
            Tabletop roleplaying games began as a divergence systems heavy war game simulation by giving players rules for resolution and allowing creativity to be driving force of the system's limits. Most table top roleplaying games 
            limit the games focused to a small band of characters or a shared organization.</p> 
            <p>Project Barony was developed to facilitate a high-level fictional faction game based heavily on abstract rules and a "fiction-first" play style. The system was heavily inspired by Kevin Crawford's science fiction 
                TTRPG, Worlds without Number and it's robust faction system. The faction system of Worlds without Number allows a Game Master to simulate and entire universe of factions, planets, assets, and behaviors. The game was intentionally developed for 
                one person to play alone, creating a living world as a backround for a traditional "sword and sorcery" experience. However the potential of the faction game as a narrative experience of it's one was discovered by Dungeon World's co-creator Adam Koebel 
                when he decided to hand the control of his Worlds without Number factions to his public community. Watching the community now known as Unrestricted Lorefare evolve and develop a living world inspired me to create my own faction based tabletop roleplayingg game.
                In contrast to Kevin Krawford's heavier system, Project Barony is focused on heavy abstraction of mechanics and empowering the creativity of players over realistic logistical management. 
            </p>

            <p>The goal of Project Barony was to create a living world where players could manage a faction the size of a city state by spending no more than 15 minutes at a time. To do this Project Barony focuses on the narrative of intention rather than the 
                realistic logistics needed to execute. The mechanics of the game serve as a framework, players are able to bounce off of to perform their intented tasks. Project Barony is based off the System Reference Document for UFO Press's World of Legacy.
                World of Legacy provides a framework for abstracting the intentions of large factions but Project Barony builds upon the framework by treating a player's faction as their character. In contrast to Worlds without Number, Project Barony only 
                requires the player to general stats and holdings versus a laundry list of assets. 
            </p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 ">
            <p>Players have a general list of moves they can use as a spring board for accomplishing their desired actions. Project Barony and World of Legacy are based off the Powered by the Apocalypse system which provides players with limited but broadly applicable actions. 
                Alternativily to other tabletop roleplaying such as Dungeons and Dragons, contested rolls do not exist in Powered by the Apocalypse. The result of rolls are reative to the roller's actions which eliminates stat and damage exchanging reminicant of war games.
                Project Barony is an adversarial game where players frequently come into conflict. The Powered by the Apocalpyse system resolves these high-level conflicts with a single roll.
            </p>
            <p> Project Barony began as an experiment where 16 individuals particpated as lords of territories in the same country. The players created factions using an array of stats similar to those found in roleplaying games. Each faction could be indexed along three stats, force,
                cunning, and weird. Force determines how strong the faction is with direct conflict. Cunning determines how strong the faction is with indirect conflict and espionage. Weird determines how proficent the faction is at understanding and mainipulating the supernatural forces
                with in the world. Two consumable resources, intel and wealth, functioned indirectly as faction stats providing boosts in proportion to the amount spent.</p> <p>Project Barony ran successfully for one round of player before problems began showing in the system. For the experiment, 
                I had only developed an minimum ruleset which was heavily stressed by the demands of the players contributing. Each player was able to easily execute and resolve actions spanning from creating trade deals, performing sabatoge operations, dealing with monster incursions,
                and beginning the construction of a personal navy. Project Barony proved the potential for heavily abstracted faction-based tabletop roleplaying game and I canceled the experiment. Development of the project is currently halted but I will be returning to make major revisions 
                and build Project Barony into a proprer, robust system.
